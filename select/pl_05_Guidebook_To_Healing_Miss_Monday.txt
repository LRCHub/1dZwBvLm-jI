It's time to stop calling
them nightmares
'Cause I'm wide awake
and you're not there
Been gone for a while
And it's been so hard tryna
fake every smile
And nothing's changed
in the apartment
I've left everything
how you left it
Your keys on the floor
It still gives me hope
that you'll knock on the door
And I've been hiding my emotions
'Cause I'm really
scared of showing
That I'm lying
And I know it
Maybe that's my way of coping
I tried it all, I tried my best
But nothing's working
since you left
I'm still searching for meaning
But there's not much left
to believe in
I've tried it all,
but can't move on
When did everything go wrong?
There's no cure for the feeling
There's no guidebook to healing
Oh, no, no
There's no guidebook to healing
Oh, no, no
There's no guidebook to healing
I should delete all of the texts
'Cause I'm checking them twice
before bed
And start living my life
'Cause sometimes I'm stuck in
just tryna survive
And I've been hiding my emotions
'Cause I'm really
scared of showing
That I'm lying
And I know it
Maybe that's my way of coping
I tried it all, I tried my best
But nothing's working
since you left
I'm still searching for meaning
But there's not much left
to believe in
I've tried it all,
but can't move on
When did everything go wrong?
There's no cure for the feeling
There's no guidebook to healing
I've been losing my mind
I've been stuck in my head
The more that I try
The more I forget
That the truth is
The truth is
There's no guidebook
I've been losing my mind
I've been stuck in my head
The more that I try
The more I forget
That the truth is
Oh, the truth is
There's no guidebook to healing
I've tried it all,
but can't move on
When did everything go wrong?
There's no cure for the feeling
There's no guidebook to healing
