You're desperate to feel more
For once in your life
Looking in all the right places
For what you're missing tonight
If you need some help?
I'll be your guided tour
The life you wanted and more
It's what you wanted and more?
I'll be your guiding light
See what you've had to endure
We gave these streets a name
I'll be your foot in the door
It's what you wanted and more?
And as before,
this is more than a view
If you need a light,
I'll be your guide
If you need a light,
I'll be yours
I've got no reason left to
fight it
Out on an island
Face down on the floor
Can you show me what I've
been missing?
'Cause maybe less is more
And as before,
this is more than a view
If you need a light,
I'll be your guide
If you need a light,
I'll be yours
I've got no reason left to
fight it
It's just a visit to you
Some of us don't get to choose
It's just a visit to you
Some of us don't get to choose
It's just a visit to you
Some of us don't get to choose
