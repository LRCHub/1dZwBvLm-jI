I know you well, like the contest in my pocket. Still feel your shell, your still around here. When you left i closed the door and locked it. Did not protest because you know its just fair. I dont mind if you waste away your life. Maybe you got something i have never seen, Maybe all you've got is nothing, Maybe you have been to places i have never been, Maybe all you you've seen is nothing. You keep coming back but you dont seem to get it. Im fucking fed youre the only one to blame. Aint your friend so take youre lies and shove it. Said youre changed but turned out just the same. Your reasons, explanation not excuse. Maybe you know something i have never dreamed maybe all you got is nothing.
