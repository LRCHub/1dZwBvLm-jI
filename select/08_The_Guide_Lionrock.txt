Seeds of the wind don't fight for the slipstream
Child of the love torn fighter of the love dream
Seeds that are wind born Return to the heartland
Minds that are hate-worn must return to its inner hand

Tears of the lonely should be flown like a stream
Love man and lovers only feel the power of a dream
The taking makes you weary it robs you of your patience
It kills your very contact with the journeys of the ancients

Whatever you strive to believe in; don't make a man a victim
The knowledge of our slumber is keeping people under
Awake and decipher the dreams and the music
A gift from the wiser but the fool wouldn't use it

There is a way I found
Hiding in the depths of my vision
Thoughts never lie but my voice is the cloud
Only courage intervenes in my decisions, so
Today I will cling to a friend
Telling her to meet within her mind and not a passion
Let us understands our movements
I'm making some improvements in the way I play my fashion

Away with the bonds of shame
Light liberates dark, the night bring mayhem
Away with psychological games
Our betters see the warnings
A dawn will repave them

I dispense with a sense that craves
Our knowledge to be slaves
The ignorance is linked
The tremors of time are like waves
And move the way that we think

Let nature take the controls and do the things that she said
Let love determine your goals, provide your daily bread
The wisdom will find you each day, it asks for you to try
The food will turn you away; the wise invents the cry
